A stopwatch is a timekeeping device that counts time intervals. In this project, I've created a straightforward stopwatch application with the following features:

Start: Begin timing intervals.
Pause: Pause the stopwatch.
Reset: Clear the stopwatch and start from zero.

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.
Open index.html: Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and open index.html in your web browser.
Interact with the Stopwatch: Click the buttons to start, stop, or reset the stopwatch as needed.
Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

index.html: The HTML file that contains the structure of the stopwatch interface.
style.css: The CSS file that styles the stopwatch interface.
script.js: The JavaScript file that provides functionality to the stopwatch.
